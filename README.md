## Tweaks & Workbench theming

If you want to play around with new colors, use the setting
`workbench.colorCustomizations` to customize the currently selected theme. For
example, you can add this snippet in your "settings.json" file:

```json
"workbench.colorCustomizations":{
  "tab.activeBackground": "#282c34",
  "activityBar.background": "#282c34",
  "editorGroup.background": "#282c34",
  "sideBar.background": "#282c34"
}
```

Please check the official documentation,
[Theme Color Reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/theme-color-reference),
for more helpful information.

## User definable syntax highlighting colors

You also can custom your syntax highlighting in "setting.json"
